# Energy Landscapes

This is a set of files in Matlab that allow one to fully reproduce our results clarifying the role of the electronic and lattice degrees of freedom in rare-earth nickelates, RNiO3, their heterostructures, Ca2RuO4 and epitaxially strained Ca2RuO4, as shown in our paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02271 

; Data for temperature dependent RNiO3 first obtained in our paper; data for NdNiO3/NdAlO3 superlattices obtained digitized from https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1818728116 ; bulk RNiO3 from: https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.99.245127  Ca2RuO4 data from: https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.067601
