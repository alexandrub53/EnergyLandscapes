# Energy Landscapes

This is a set of files in Matlab that allow one to fully reproduce our results clarifying the role of the electronic and lattice degrees of freedom in rare-earth nickelates, RNiO3, their heterostructures, Ca2RuO4 and epitaxially strained Ca2RuO4, as shown in our paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02271 

Data for temperature dependent RNiO3 first obtained in our paper; 
Data for NdNiO3/NdAlO3 superlattices obtained digitized from https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1818728116 ; 
Bulk RNiO3 from: https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.99.245127  
Ca2RuO4 data from: https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.067601 


Update: the bulkRNO data has additional results for U=2.1eV, J=1.2eV, and U=2.1eV, J=1.15eV, \beta=40, comparing results for NdNiO3 and Nd_{0.75}La_{0.25}NiO3. Additionally, an HDF5 file has been provided for the metallic state, at Q=0, as well as text files and plots extracted from these files for the imaginary part of the self-energy, \Sigma, and imaginary part of the Green's function, both on the Matsubara axis. This data is used for a collaboration with experiment which will be posted on arXiv soon and linked to here.
